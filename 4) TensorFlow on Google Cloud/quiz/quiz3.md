## The L2 regularization provides which of the following?

`It adds a sum of the squared parameter weights term to the loss function.`

---

## During the training process, each additional layer in your network can successively reduce signal vs. noise. How can we fix this?

`Use non-saturating, nonlinear activation functions such as ReLUs.`

---

## Non-linearity helps in training your model at a much faster rate and with more accuracy without the loss of your important information?

`True`

---

## The Keras Functional API can be characterized by having:

`Multiple inputs and outputs and models with shared layers.`

---

## The predict function in the tf.keras API returns what?

`Numpy array(s) of predictions`

---

## What is the significance of the Fit method while training a Keras model?

`Defines the number of epochs`

---

## How does regularization help build generalizable models ?

`By adding dropout layers to our neural networks`

---

## Select the correct statement regarding the Keras Functional API.

`Unlike the Keras Sequential API, we have to provide the shape of the input to the model`

---

## How does Adam (optimization algorithm) help in compiling the Keras model?

`Both by updating network weights iteratively based on training data by diagonal rescaling of the gradients`
