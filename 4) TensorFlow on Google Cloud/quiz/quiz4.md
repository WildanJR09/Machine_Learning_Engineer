## To make your code compatible with Verte AI, there are three basic steps that must be completed in a specific order. Choose the answer that best describes those steps.

`First, upload data to Google Cloud Storage. Next, move code into a trainer Python package. Then submit your training job with gcloud to train on Vertex AI.`

---

## Which file is the entry point to your code that Vertex AI will start and contains details such as â€œhow to parse command-line arguments and where to write model outputs?

`task.py`

---

## Fill in the blanks. When sending training jobs to Vertex AI, it is common to split most of the logic into a \***\*\_\*\*** and a \***\*\_\_\_\*\*** file.

`task.py, model.py`

---

## When you package up a TensorFlow model as a Python Package, what statement should every Python module contain in every folder?

`an init_.py`

---

## Fill in the blanks. You can use either pre-built containers or custom containers to run training jobs. Both containers require you specify settings that Vertex AI needs to run your training code, including \***\*\_\_\*\***, \***\*\_\_\_\_\*\***, and **\_\_\_\_**.

`Region, display-name, worker-pool-spec`
