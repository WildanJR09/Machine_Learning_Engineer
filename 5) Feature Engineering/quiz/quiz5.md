## True or False:

We can create many different kinds of feature crosses.
For example:
• [A X B]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of two features.
• [A x B x C x D x E]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of five features.
• [A x A]: a feature cross formed by squaring a single feature.

`True`

## Why might you create an embedding of a feature cross?

`All of the options are correct.`

## True or False:

In TensorFlow Playground, orange and blue are used throughout the visualization in slightly different ways, but in general orange shows negative values while blue shows positive values.

`True`

---

## True or False:

In TensorFlow Playground, the data points (represented by small circles) are initially colored orange or blue, which correspond to zero and negative one.

`False`

---

## True or False:

In TensorFlow Playground, in the output layer, the dots are colored orange or blue depending on their original values. The background color shows what the network is predicting for a particular area. The intensity of the color shows how confident that prediction is.

`True`

## Fill in the blanks:

In the \***\*\_\_\*\*** layers, the lines are colored by the \***\*\_\_\*\*** of the connections between neurons. Blue shows a \***\*\_\*\*** weight, which means the network is using that \***\*\_\*\*** of the neuron as given. An orange line shows that the network is assigning a \***\*\_\_\*\*** weight.
