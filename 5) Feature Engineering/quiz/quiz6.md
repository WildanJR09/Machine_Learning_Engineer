## True or False: One of the goals of tf.Transform is to provide a TensorFlow graph for preprocessing that can be incorporated into the serving graph (and, optionally, the training graph).

`True`

## What does tf.Transform do during the training and serving phase?

`Provides a TensorFlow graph for preprocessing`

## Fill in the blank: The **\*\***\_\_**\*\*** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** is the most important concept of tf.Transform. The **\*\***\_\_**\*\*** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** is a logical description of a transformation of the dataset. The **\*\***\_\_**\*\*** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means Tensor or 2D SparseTensor.

`Preprocessing function`
