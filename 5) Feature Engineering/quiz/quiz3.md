## Which of the following statements are true regarding the ML.EVALUATE function?

`All of the options are correct.`

---

## What do you use the tf.feature_column.bucketized_column function for?

`To discretize floating point values into a smaller number of categorical bins`

---

## What is one-hot encoding?

`One-hot encoding is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that could be provided to neural networks to do a better job in prediction.`

---

## What is the significance of ML.FEATURE_CROSS?

`ML.FEATURE_CROSS generates a STRUCT feature with all combinations of crossed categorical features except for 1-degree items.`

---

## Which of the following statements are true regarding the ML.BUCKETIZE function?

`Both options are correct.`

---

## True or False:

Feature Engineering is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for three main reasons:

1. You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.
2. You can bring in your own domain expertise.
3. Once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise.

`True`

## What is a feature cross?

`A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by multiplying (crossing) two or more features. Crossing combinations of features can provide predictive abilities beyond what those features can provide individually.`

---

## Which of the following is true about Feature Cross?

`Both options are correct.`
